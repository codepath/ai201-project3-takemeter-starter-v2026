# Running TakeMeter

Everything about how the starter works.

This pair is different from the last two: **you train a model.** It runs on
your own machine, in a notebook, from inside this repo. No accounts, no keys,
nothing hosted.

---

## Before your first class

One setup, one virtual environment, everything in this repo. The
[environment setup page](../pages/ide_setup) has the per-operating-system
commands.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python test.py
```

**`python test.py` passing is what you need before your first session.** It
checks your Python version against the pins, your disk, your memory, and
whether the packages import.

**Your disk needs about 9 GB free, up from 6.** The baseline model is roughly
1.6 GB and PyTorch is not small.

**Your machine needs about 6 GB of RAM.** Two things here are memory-hungry:
`baseline.py` peaks around 1.8 GB loading the zero-shot model, and the training
run peaks around 2.1 GB. Neither is comfortable beside an editor and a browser
on a 4 GB machine. `test.py` warns you.

You'll see one `[WARN] Baseline model — not downloaded yet`. That's expected in
unit 5. **Clear it before the unit 6 session** by running `python baseline.py`
once — downloading 1.6 GB during class is not how you want to spend a breakout.

> **No API key and no accounts for this pair.** Nothing here calls a hosted
> model. The baseline and the training both run on your own machine.

### What you'll be training on

`test.py` tells you, and so does section 1 of the notebook. There are three
possibilities and all of them work:

| Device | What it means | Speed |
|---|---|---|
| `cuda` | An NVIDIA GPU | Under a minute per seed |
| `mps` | Apple Silicon — M1 and later | Fast; much quicker than the CPU path |
| `cpu` | Everything else | A few minutes per seed. Three seeds is a coffee, not an afternoon |

⚠️ **Write down which one you get.** It is part of your result, not a detail
about your laptop. Two people running the same notebook on the same data with
the same seed can get different numbers, because different hardware does the
arithmetic in a slightly different order. Unit 6 asks you to report it beside
your three seeds, and `results.json` records it for you.

---

## The notebook

`takemeter.ipynb` runs **on your own machine**, from inside this repo.

1. Open it in VS Code (or `jupyter notebook`, if you prefer).
2. **Pick the kernel: the `.venv` inside this project.** In VS Code that's the
   selector in the top right. Getting this wrong is the most common way the
   first cell fails — it will say a package isn't installed when it is,
   because it's looking at a different Python.
3. Fill in the two lines at the top of section 1's second cell — your name and
   email. They only label your results.

> ⚠️ **Open it from your repo, not from a copy.** The notebook writes next to
> your code and expects `labels.csv` to be there. If you open a copy from your
> Downloads folder, it will tell you so rather than failing strangely.

### It reads and writes this folder

There is nothing to upload and nothing to download. `labels.csv` is already
here; `results.json`, `test_split.csv` and `results_three_seeds_*.json` land
here when the notebook writes them.

**Commit them yourself**, the way you commit anything else. Nothing is pushed
for you.

- Section 5 writes `results.json` and `test_split.csv` — **unit 5**
- Section 6 writes `results_three_seeds_<label>.json` — **unit 6**.
  Set `RUN_LABEL = "after"` in that cell before the Milestone 5 re-run, or the
  improvement overwrites the numbers you're comparing against.

> **Add rows to `labels.csv` mid-session?** Re-run section 2, which is what
> reads the file. The notebook holds the data in memory once it has read it.

> **Your edits to the notebook itself are yours to commit too.** `LABELS`, the
> settings and the seed live in the file — if you change them, that's a change
> to your repo like any other.

### What's in it

| Section | When | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Setup | unit 5 | Reports your device, and confirms it can see your files |
| 2. Your labels | unit 5 | `LABELS`, the settings, and **the seed** |
| 3. Split | unit 5 | 70/15/15, stratified |
| 4. Train | unit 5 | Minutes on a laptop CPU, under one on a GPU |
| 5. Results | unit 5 | Writes `results.json` and `test_split.csv` |
| 6. Three seeds | **unit 6** | Retrains three times in one cell |
| 7. Confusion matrix | **unit 6** | Prints a markdown table to paste |

Sections 6 and 7 are next week. Nothing in unit 5 needs them.

## Your data

`labels.csv` in your repo. Three columns:

| Column | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `text` | The whole post. Don't trim it to fit |
| `label` | One of your labels, spelled **exactly** as in `LABELS` |
| `note` | `cold` for the 20 you labelled unaided, and a note on any you pre-labelled |

`labels_template.csv` shows the shape. `data/practice_labels.csv` is the set
used in class — 60 posts from a fictional running forum, already labelled, so
you can run the whole notebook before you have data of your own.

**One file, unsplit.** Don't split it yourself — the notebook does the 70/15/15
split, and splitting twice is how examples leak between training and test.

### The check before training

Section 2's last cell looks for the things that break a run or quietly ruin it:

| It says | What it means |
|---|---|
| `[FIX ME] Labels in your CSV that aren't in LABELS` | A spelling or capital mismatch. `Hot_take` and `hot_take` are different |
| `[FIX ME] 'x' is 78% of your data` | Over the brief's 70% cap. The model will learn to guess it |
| `[look at] N duplicate posts` | They'll land in different splits and inflate your score. That's leakage |
| `[look at] Only 12 examples of 'x'` | Its test split will be tiny, so its F1 will jump between seeds |
| `[look at] 60 rows` | Under the submission floor. Training still runs — fine for the practice data |

---

## The baseline — unit 6

```bash
python baseline.py
python baseline.py --trained results.json
```

This runs a general model over your posts using **only your label
definitions**, with no training. It's the fair opponent your fine-tuned model
has to beat.

**It scores `test_split.csv`** — the held-out posts the notebook saved in unit 5,
the same ones your trained model was measured on. Two numbers from two different
sets of posts aren't a comparison, which is why it reads that file rather than
picking its own sample. If the file isn't there it says so, falls back to a
random sample of `labels.csv`, and tells you to disclose that in your README.

Runs **on your machine**. No account, no key. A few seconds per post, so 30
posts takes a couple of minutes — that slowness is itself part of the finding.

Put your definitions in `label_definitions.txt`, one per line as
`label: definition`, copied from your README. **The definitions are the prompt** —
they're the entire input the model gets.

Without the file it falls back to bare label names, which is a much weaker
prompt. Worth doing on purpose once: run it both ways and the gap between the
two accuracies is what your definitions were worth, measured instead of assumed.
If you report the bare-names run as your baseline, say so in your README.

The second command adds a Trained column and prints the **Baseline vs.
Trained** table ready to paste.

---

## The agreement check — unit 6

Staff labelled 30 posts under the taxonomy in `data/staff_taxonomy.md`. You
label the same 30 under **those** definitions — not the ones you designed in
unit 5 — and then compare.

```bash
python agreement.py
```

Four files. The posts and the rules ship with the starter; only the answers
come from your TF, and only after yours are done. Posts and labels join on `id`:

| File | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| `data/staff_taxonomy.md` | **Ships in the starter.** The three definitions and the decision rules staff used. Read it first — you label under *these*, not your own |
| `data/staff_posts.csv` | **Ships in the starter.** The 30 posts, no labels |
| `data/staff_labels.csv` | **Your TF gives you this**, once your own labels are done |
| `my_staff_labels.csv` | You make it: the same posts, labelled by you, with `text` and `label` columns |

**You label the staff set under the staff taxonomy, not the one you designed in
unit 5.** Your own taxonomy was yours to invent; this one is somebody else's to
apply, and whether you can apply a written rule the way its authors did is the
only evidence you have about whether your own 200 labels were consistent.

Put both staff files in `data/` under those names and the bare command finds
them. Anywhere else, point at them:

```bash
python agreement.py --staff-posts posts.csv --staff-labels labels.csv
```

Posts are matched on their text, so **paste it unchanged**. Retype or trim a
post and it won't match — the script tells you which ones didn't.

It works out the rate and lists every disagreement. **It stops there on
purpose.** The rate is arithmetic; the adjudication is the graded part, and your
README has a block to fill in for each one.

> This is the only instrument you have that can tell a labelling problem from a
> model problem. Milestone 4 asks you to use it as exactly that — a label pair
> you disagreed with staff about, and that your matrix also confuses, is a
> finding about your labels rather than about the model.

|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pick a community and read it | Nothing to run. Read for 20 minutes |
| 2 | Design your labels | README, **Label Taxonomy** |
| 3 | Write your criteria | `criteria.md` — all five are yours this time |
| 4 | Collect and label 200 | `labels.csv` |
| 5 | Run the training | Notebook, sections 1–5 |
| 6 | Write it up | README |

### Unit 6 — the test

| Milestone | What you're doing | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Run the baseline | `baseline.py` |
| 2 | Retrain three times, read the matrix | Notebook, sections 6–7 |
| 3 | Check yourself against the staff labels | `agreement.py` |
| 4 | Call each criterion, diagnose the misses | README |
| 5 | Fix one thing and re-run | Notebook, section 6 with `RUN_LABEL = "after"` |
| 6 | Say what's still broken | README |

## When something goes wrong

| What you see | What it means |
|---|---|
| Section 1 says `cpu` | Correct on most laptops, and fine. A three-seed run is minutes. Nothing to fix |
| `CLONE FAILED` | Read the three causes it prints. Usually `REPO` has the whole URL in it instead of just the name |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` in the notebook | Wrong kernel. Pick the `.venv` inside this project, top right in VS Code |
| `FileNotFoundError: labels.csv` | It isn't committed and pushed yet. Do that on your laptop, then re-run the connect cell |
| The push failed, or nothing pushed | Your token expired, or it's missing **Contents: Read and write**. Make a new one |
| Your files vanished mid-session | The session reset. Re-run section 1 — the clone comes back |
| The machine crawls during training | Close the browser and anything heavy. Training peaks around 2.1 GB |
| `KeyError` during training | A label in your CSV isn't in `LABELS`. Check capitals and spaces |
| Training takes an hour | You're on CPU. See the first row |
| Accuracy swings 15 points between seeds | Your dataset is too small or too lopsided for a stable measure. **That's a diagnosis, not a mistake** — write it down |
| A label's F1 is 0.00 | It probably has almost nothing in the test split. Check the split table |
| `baseline.py` says no `test_split.csv` | Unit 5's results section never finished. Re-run it, or note in your README that your comparison isn't like-for-like |
| `baseline.py` is downloading forever | First run only, ~1.6 GB. Do it before class |
| The baseline is very slow | Expected. A few seconds per post is what no fine-tuning costs at runtime |

The three usual causes when the notebook fails, in order: the runtime isn't set
to GPU, the session reset and the clone is gone, or a label in your CSV doesn't
match `LABELS` exactly.

If none of those fix it, commit your CSV and criteria and write down the error.
**You have a labelled dataset and a filed standard, which is most of the
week's grade.**

## A note on committing

At least four commits in unit 5, four more in unit 6. Your commit history is
what shows your criteria existed before your results did.

The `results*.json` files are deliberately **not** in `.gitignore`. They're
evidence the run happened, and so are `test_split.csv` and `labels.csv`. The
notebook writes them; you commit them, along with `criteria.md`,
`baseline_results.json` and your README.

**One machine, one repo.** Everything happens here, so there's nothing to pull
before you push.

**Do not delete and recreate this repository.** You submit the same URL both
weeks.
