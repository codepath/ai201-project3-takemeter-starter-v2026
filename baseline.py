The baseline. ← UNIT 6, MILESTONE 1

Before you judge your trained model, find out how hard the task is without one.

This runs a general model over your held-out posts using **only your label
definitions** — no training, no examples. That's called zero-shot, and it's a
fair opponent. If it matches your fine-tuned model, your training added
nothing, and that is a finding worth having rather than a failure.

**The same posts, both models.** Section 5 of the notebook writes the held-out
split to `test_split.csv` and commits it. This reads that file, so the two
columns of your Baseline vs. Trained table are scored on one set of posts. A
comparison across two different sets isn't a comparison.

Everything here runs **on your own machine**. No account, no key, nothing to
sign up for. It is slower than the trained model — expect a few seconds per
post, so 30 posts takes a couple of minutes. That's normal, and it's part of
the point: this is what "no fine-tuning" costs you at runtime as well as in
accuracy.

The first run downloads the model, about 1.6 GB. Do that before class, not
during.
