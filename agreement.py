"""
The agreement check. ← UNIT 6, MILESTONE 3

Staff labelled 30 posts under the taxonomy in `data/staff_taxonomy.md`. You
label the same 30 under those same definitions — not your own — and this works
out how often you matched and lists every post where you didn't.

Read `data/staff_taxonomy.md` first. Applying somebody else's written rule the
way they applied it is the whole exercise, and it is the only evidence you have
about whether your own 200 labels were consistent.

    python agreement.py --help
    python agreement.py
    python agreement.py --staff-posts data/staff_posts.csv \
                        --staff-labels data/staff_labels.csv --mine my_labels.csv
    python agreement.py --staff data/staff_combined.csv --mine my_labels.csv

**Label the posts before you run this.** The rate is arithmetic and the script
does it for you. The adjudication is the graded part and the script deliberately
does not touch it — it hands you the disagreements and an empty column.

This is the only instrument you have that can tell a labelling problem from a
model problem, which is exactly what Milestone 4 asks you to use it for.

The staff set comes as two files. `data/staff_posts.csv` and
`data/staff_taxonomy.md` ship in the starter; `data/staff_labels.csv` is the
one your TF sends you, once yours are done. Posts and labels join on `id`. Your
own file needs a `text` column and a `label` column. If you happen to have the
staff posts and labels already in one file, pass it with `--staff` instead.

Posts are matched on their text, so paste it unchanged — if you retype or trim
a post it won't match and the script will tell you which one.
